# About Us

We are the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery.
Our club is a place for students to foster their interest in computing through shared study, workshops, events, and resources.
Our biggest event is [MinneHack](https://www.minnehack.com/), a yearly hackathon with prompts focused on building communities and civic engagement.
We welcome members of all majors, and our club room is a great place to study and hang out!

## ACM Club Room

Our club room in Keller Hall 2-204 is open during our [open house](@/events.md), as well as any time the lights are on and the door is open!
It has tables to study and chat, modern and retro electronics, and a server closet where we host this site.
The best way to learn about ACM UMN is to come check it out.

## ACM National

Our parent organization, [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/) (ACM), is a global computing society, dedicated to advancing art, science, and engineering.
ACM publishes academic writing, hosts conferences, and promotes diversity and ethics in computing.
