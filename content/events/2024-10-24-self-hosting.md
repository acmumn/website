Learn how to self host your own services!

<!-- more -->

*Why self host?*

Self hosting can be done for many different reasons but a main one is being able to control the services that you use.
Self hosting can be done on a physical machine that you own, a virtual machine, or a virtual private server (VPS) for anything you can think of.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

Some prior knowledge from UNIX Classes would be recommended but it's not required for this!

## What will be Covered in this class?

We will go over why you might want to self host and some networking basics.
We will also go over what contanerization is and the different levels that you can compartmentalize services.
Options for self hosting if you can't or don't want to do it at home will also be discussed along with some services you might want to use!
