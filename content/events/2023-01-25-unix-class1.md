Learn practical UNIX skills!

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend virtually?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required!

## What Will the class cover?

This one will cover basic shell commands, including how to interact with the filesystem from the command line!
If you've never used UNIX or the command line before, this is a great primer.

## Where are the UNIX Classes?

Keller Hall 3-210
