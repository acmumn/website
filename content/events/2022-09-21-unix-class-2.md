## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The second UNIX Class will be on git! 
Git is a system for managing different versions of your code that you will use in a lot of your computer science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

It would be helpful to have attended the first UNIX class, but you should be able to follow along even if you haven't :)


## Where are the UNIX Classes?

Keller Hall 3-125.
