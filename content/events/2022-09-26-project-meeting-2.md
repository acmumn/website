Build a cool thing with ACM!

<!-- more -->
## What are the project meetings?

Are you looking for a cool project to **add to your resume**?
Do you want to learn new things, and end up with a cool piece of software that
you made yourself at the end? Do you just want to eat pizza and work on an
interesting project? **Then you should come to the ACM project meetings!**
We'll get together and work on a cool project every week, and by the end,
you'll have learned a lot, have some real world experience, and have a cool
project to show for it!

## What do I need to know before I attend?

Some programming experience is required --
**If you've taken freshman level computer science classes, that's enough!**
You'll learn everything else you need to know while working on the project.

## Where are the project meetings?

Keller 2-204 (the ACM room!)
