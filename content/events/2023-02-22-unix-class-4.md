Learn practical UNIX skills!

<!-- more -->

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend virtually?

You should have a basic understanding of the shell and pipes, like you would get from unix class #1 and #3.
If you missed unix class #2, that's fine! We won't be building off of that in this class.

## What will be Covered in this class?

We will be covering advanced shell features.

## Where are the UNIX Classes?

The meeting is here: [https://umn.zoom.us/j/94585508360?pwd=QmRYamtnaHN6M3BBVUE4cFdsMjNsQT09](https://umn.zoom.us/j/94585508360?pwd=QmRYamtnaHN6M3BBVUE4cFdsMjNsQT09)
