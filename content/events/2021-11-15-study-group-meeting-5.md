## What is this?

This is a meeting for the ACM Study Buddies. The ACM UMN is facilitating
a study group program this semester for computer science coursework.
Studying with other people makes the whole ordeal suck a bit less and
might also help you meet new friends :)

## Sounds great, how do I get involved?

[Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_If4seETqZ-vXAh0raza49NvuAYzz8REmk4LBZU3-U_74-g/viewform) and we'll get you matched up.

## Where is it?

The synchronous meetings will be in [The ACM room](/room),  Keller Hall
2-204. We also **strongly encourage** you to meet with your study groups
outside of the formal meetings, which exist only to help you get started
and also provide you with **free food**. Did we mention the **free food**?
