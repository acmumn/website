## What is a "Blog Workshop"?

Making a website can be daunting. The ACM UMN can help! Our Blog Workshop series of events will
focus on helping everybody set up their very own personal site. And pizza. We'll have pizza.

## What is this specific meeting for?

We will be going over advanced features of zola, such creating different categories for different types of post.

## What do I need to know?

You should have a reasonable understanding of how zola works, which you should have gotten from the first two meetings!

## Sounds cool, where and when is this happening?

Keller Hall 3-125 at 18:00 on March 11th. Be there or be square!

## Organizer
