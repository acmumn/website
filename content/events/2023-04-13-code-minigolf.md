Make small programs with us!



<!-- more -->

## What is this?

This is an event where we give you a prompt, and you need to write the smallest program (in number of characters) to do it!
Check out the [Code Golf Stack Exchange Form](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) to get a better idea of what that looks like!
This is a more low-key competition than a lot of our other events. We will have a series of smaller challenges that you will try to complete with the smallest program possible.
There are no prises for this one, other than the fun you had and the smug self satisifaction you will get from beating all your classmates :).
