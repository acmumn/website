The last in a series of classes to make your own blog (woah!). Experience in web development is not needed to attend. This week we will cover advanced topics.

<!-- more -->

Ever wanted to make a blog, a portfolio website, or generally a cute little home on the web? Come to Blog Workshop! We'll cover how to make a website, starting from basic Markdown and HTML and ending with a site that's all your own. The first session will cover the environment setup as well as some basic Markdown, the second covering some HTML and CSS, and the third will finish up what we've started and cover some more advanced topics.

(not Student Services Fee funded)
