Learn practical UNIX skills!

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend virtually?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required!
If you missed the previous class, that's not required for this one, so feel free to attend!

## What will be Covered in this class?

This class will be covering what Nix, Nixpkgs, and NixOS are and how to use them.
Nix is a declaritive language which is used in Nixpkgs to define packages. NixOS is is a Linux distribution that uses the Nix language for configuration and packages.
