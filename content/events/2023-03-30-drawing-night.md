Draw with ACM!

<!-- more -->

Come hang out in the ACM room with Drawing Night! 

Relax and draw with us in the room, or come decorate a banner with the officers to hang up in the ACM room. Alternatively, we will also be making collaborative comics and will provide paper and drawing supplies (pens, colored pencils, charcoal, etc.).

no

## Where is this again?
