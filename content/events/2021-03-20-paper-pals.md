## What's this about?

Read the paper and talk about it with fellow students! Paper TBD.

## What do I need to know beforehand?

Nothing! The paper should have some interesting concepts no matter how much you know about computer science.
If you read it and aren't sure about something, that's fine! That's why there's a dicussion.

## Where can I get the paper?
TBD.

## Where is Paper Pals?
We will be having paper pals in the general voice channel on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/Uzt3adQ).
