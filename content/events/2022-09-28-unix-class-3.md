## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The third UNIX Class will be on Vim, the world's best text editor!
If you have ever wanted to be faster while editing code, or just have an option to use while connected to a lab computer, vim is for you!

## What do I need to know before I attend?

It would be helpful to have attended the first and second UNIX classes, but you should be able to follow along even if you haven't :)

## Where are the UNIX Classes?

Keller Hall 3-125.
