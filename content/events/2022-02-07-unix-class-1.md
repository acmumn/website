Learn practical UNIX skills!

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend virtually?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required!

## Where are the UNIX Classes?

The Zoom link will magically appear on this very page when the event gets closer. We'll also send out an email blast.
