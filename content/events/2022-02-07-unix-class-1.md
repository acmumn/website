Learn practical UNIX skills!

<!-- more -->

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required! Just bring yourself, your laptop, and a hunger for **pizza**.

## What dietary restrictions do you cater to?

We always have vegan and vegetarian options! We also (usually) bring lactaid for people who like cheese pizza, but cannot consume lactose. 

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.

## Where are the UNIX Classes?
TBD! We'll send out an email blast, probably.
