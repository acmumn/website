Build a cool thing with ACM!

<!-- more -->
Are you looking for a cool project to add to your resume?
Do you want to learn new things, and end up with a cool piece of software that you made yourself at the end?
Do you just want to eat pizza and work on an interesting project?
Then you should come to the ACM project  meetings!
We'll get together and work on a cool project every week, and by the end, you'll have learned a lot,
have some real world experience, and have a cool project to show for it!
Some programming experience is required -- If you've taken freshman level computer science classes, that's enough!
You'll learn everything else you need to know while working on the project.

If you're at all interested, you should fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9xhvrCa-uLOTnSR-CSwhwjJPnsmI2_jv4M4rt4RkWP9HKDg/viewform?usp=sf_link), where you can help decide what project we'll work on, and when we will meet!
This will also help us figure out some technical details, like what programming language(s) we will use.


## When will we be meeting?
There will be one meeting a week at the same time and day of the week of the first meeting, which is going to be decided by a whentomeet in [THIS FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9xhvrCa-uLOTnSR-CSwhwjJPnsmI2_jv4M4rt4RkWP9HKDg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
