Learn practical UNIX skills!

<!-- more -->

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend virtually?

You should have a basic understanding of the shell, like you would get from unix class #1.
If you missed unix class #2, that's fine! We won't be building off of that in this class.

## What will be Covered in this class?

We will be covering pipes, filters, and processes. All ways to deal with the output you get from programs.


## Where are the UNIX Classes?

Keller Hall 3-210.
