Drop on by and say hi! Now with pizza.

## What is this?

This is a designated time for people curious about the ACM UMN to drop
in :) To be clear, anybody is welcome anytime as long as there is an ACM
UMN member currently in the room, but we've designated this time 
specifically to accommodate new potential memebers.

**Pizza will be provided.** Everybody likes free food, right?

## Where is this?

[The ACM room](/room), Keller Hall 2-204.
