# Membership

We welcome new members from all majors and colleges.
Members get access to our club room, [Discord](@/discord.md), and virtual machines on our servers (as available).
Stop by the room during [open house](@/events.md) and we can help you with becoming a member.

## Becoming a Member

In order to become a member, you must attend 3 events.
These can be open house, the officers meeting, a workshop, or anything on the [events calendar](@/events.md).
If you believe you have done this, fill out the [membership signup form](@/member.md) and contact an officer.

## ACM National

ACM UMN is distinct from ACM National, and membership in ACM UMN does not provide membership in ACM National.
