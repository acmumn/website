# Membership

We welcome new members from all majors and colleges.
Members get access to our club room, [discord](@/discord.md), and virtual machines on our servers (as available).
Our club room is open whenever the lights are on and the door is open, which is pretty often!
Stop by the room during [open house](@/events.md) and we can help you with becoming a member.

### Becoming a Member

In order to become a member, you must attend 3 events.
These can be open house, the officers meeting, a workshop, or anything on the [events calendar](@/events.md).
If you believe you have done this, talk to an officer in the club room or on the discord and we can help get you signed off.

#### ACM National

ACM UMN is distinct from ACM National, and membership in ACM UMN does not provide membership in ACM National.
