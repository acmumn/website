# Membership

We welcome new members! We have members from lots of majors and colleges, it's not just for Computer Science majors. Members get card access to our club room, discord access, and VMs on our servers (as available). Stop by the room during [open house](@/events.md) and we can help you with the process.

## Becoming a Member

Members are required to attend 3 events before joining. These can be open house, the officers meeting, a workshop, or anything on the [events calendar](@/events.md). If you believe you have done this, talk to an officer in the club room or on the discord and we can help get you signed off.

### ACM National

ACM UMN is distinct from ACM National, and membership in ACM UMN does not provide membership in ACM National.
