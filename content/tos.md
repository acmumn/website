ACM UMN Terms of Service
============

We are a student organization, and are not able to offer the same guarantees or protections that a for-profit service might be able to. Before requesting and operating a virtual machine with ACM UMN, please accept and abide by these expectations and rules. 

- The uptime, data, and privacy of our networks are not guaranteed, though we will attempt to maintain them.
- Support from ACM systems administrators will be limited to networking configuration, password and bootloader recovery, and ensuring power supply to the VM/server. Other support is at the discretion of the officers.
- Don't run illegal operations on your VM, and don't run a DNS server/resolver
