## Topics for Discussion
- Prepackaged everything for snacks\
- Iris "dug into" the MH tee details
 - Got a rough quote
 - Steve has not gotten back about tee sizes
    - Other sponsor has
    - We will get a surplus of black shirts because it's cool
    - Normalize the following proportional distribution to the ideal shirt count of 180:
    -   Small: 6
    -   Medium: 26
    -   Large: 24
    -   X-Large: 27
    -   X-Small: 3
    -   XX-Large: 1
- In previous years we have counted both in-persons and out-persons as in-persons for attendance
    - Actual in-persons are closer to 150 than the full count of 370
    - We think we can fairly safely say 150 attendants
        - 200 aspirational
    - Better to over-plan than under-plan
- In terms of bags...
    - We can not put the year on it so we could reuse them for later years
    - Plus the numbers "look bad" -Iris
    - Simple design, just yellow with this year's logo
    - Getting them from "Totally Promotional"
- Finalize minihacks
    - Ideas:
        - Mini-CTF
            - Need to start working on it rn if so
            - But actually we are not doing this one
                - We already do this one other times and we are doing advent of code - similar
        - Code Golf
            - Need to start working on it rn
        - Smash Tourney (could bring wii and gamecube controllers!)
        - Presentation Karaoke
            - Fairly easy to get going
            - Projector package should be set
        - Like Mini-"Advent of Code"
            - Need to start working on it rn
    - Hacking starts at 2pm, ends at noon next day. Mini-hacks every 3 hours
        - Start them at 5pm, then 8pm...
            - 5pm: set-and-forgets like code golf and advent (simultaneous)
            - 8pm: more real, like smash tourney or presentation karaoke
            - 10am: close up these mini-hacks
            - Unfortunately no time for fourth mini-hack so we have to choose 8pm
- Schedule blast for first day/week of classes
    - First-week-of-classes email
    - First newsletter: UNIX classes, MinneHack
    - We have list of professors to email
- Diatomaceous Ã†rth
    - Covered. Just a light sprinkle here and there where it counts.
