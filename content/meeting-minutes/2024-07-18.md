# Last Week's TODOs

[N/A]

# Topics for Discussion

- TOS
   - Having both non-student members and ppl with access to server closet
      - Considering that only current students and alumni should have access to servers
      - Or that if you are not either, you require a sponsor
         - Which we could could permit but only implicitly so as to discourage a plethora of our recent case
            - It would be good to maximize transparency and communication and to encourage club friendliness
   - (Relatedly, we ought to update website with more thorough info)
   - Disclaimer: that we will do our best with servers and data but that we are not liable, nor are we anticipating perfect performance, nor are we offering to be personal assistants at a moment's or general notice
      - But that we are glad to help case-by-case and within reason, just be self-responsible
   - Explicate that access to ACM servers is a privilege and not a right so to behave accordingly, we hold the power to revoke on our own discretion
      - And that we expect server-havers to be sufficiently technically competent for server safety and our own ease of mind
   - Could peek at CSE server TOS to investigate ideas for our own
      - Overall should originally source ours tho so it is specific to our needs and absent of bloat
   - Could have a page on the site for all the necessary info for the systems
- Budget items
   - Stickers
   - Server thing
      - Medusa
      - Garlic
   - SolarWinds ($72/yr)
   - minnehack.io domain ($50/yr)

   - Autumn is poking the folk as we speak
      - Yikes! The folk are away from today through the weekend!
      - Whatever happens with that MH date-wise, we ought to get the money thing determined expeditiously
