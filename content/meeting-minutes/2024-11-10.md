# Topics for Discussion
- MH registration status
  - Should have it done by Dec. 1 at latest, preferably earlier
  - Then can do subsequent things but need to start with this
  - Opaque and sequel library something
    - Step 1. Gather information. Step 2. Do it.
    - Information we need from people to put in the DV:
      - Migrations → Sequel
    - QR code? Don't make it break. Not too ambitious.
  - Figure out emailing situation
    - Mailchimp? Nature of API....
      - Need unique content tailored to individual sends
    - Sendgrid
      - 100 emails a day for free
        - $20 a month for more than that
        - Could send them over a few days tho
          - But what if many people sign up day-of
          - So should perhaps offer up a 1-month subscription for this edge case
    - Toolio banned account historically
      - Because Proton Mail
    - Autumn can get something that works up pretty quickly
