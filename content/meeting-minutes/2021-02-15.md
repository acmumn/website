- Numerade

## Minutes
- Verify Mailchimp
  - Mike: I have done this
- Numerade
  - Charlie: They keep emailing me about wanting to sponsor ACM (not an event)
  - Louis: Tell them to sponsor UNIX classes
  - Kelton: Are these the people who wanted use to put their website on our website?
  - Charlie: I think this could be a good way to get money not controlled by the department
  - Louis: I think the department would still want the money to go through them
  - Louis: This is the whole point of the department controlling our money, so we don't give out the university's clout in exchange for money
  - Hemant: This is definitely SEO hacking, I think getting linked from a .edu site is good for page rank
  - Louis: I think we've turned this sort of thing down before, and I'm not sure I like the precedent
  - Louis: Did they say if there's a specific wording they want, or a specific length of time? Did they say a specific dollar amount?
  - Charlie: They said "several hundred dollars"
  - Louis: When companies sponsor events it's only good for that event, are they wanting this to just be for a specific length of time? Will they give ACM members a discount?
  - Cole: Realistically I think we were just on their list of scraped emails for that day
  - Cole: I'm opposed to the precedent this sets
  - Charlie: It looks like this is a free service, where does the money come from?
  - Hemant: Are they VC funded?
  - Kelton: I'm not convinced this isn't a huge scam
  - Louis: I think if we could redirect them into an sponsoring an event that would be the best course of action
  - Louis: Have we ever had an organizational sponsor before? I know we've done multiple events with [redacted] before
  - Mike: Yeah, but that wasn't formalized, we just had a specific person's email
  - [someone]: Are we even allowed to do this?
  - We got sidetracked after this
- Officers for next year?:
  - Everyone but mike is coming back probably
