# 2025-09-24 ACM Officers' Meeting

Jason discord will be purged.

VP is a fake position, Angel just needs to do whatever isn't happening.

We should start advertising at Computer Engineering courses for unix classes
next semester.

We did advertising at 1933, 2021, and 2041.

Jason can copy justifications for events from the budget for getting funding
requests.

Angel will email Neocities guy to see if he wants to give a talk.

Arbor will become scrum master. They've already put up posters, willing to help
with bookkeeping, notetaking, emails, electronics, less interested in people.

Angel gave Arbor discord access.

Angel and Sandal talked with IEEE, gopher graphics will be in the LAN party
event too.

CS&E open house next week. Angel registered us. Angel and Alison will be
guaranteed in attendance.

Alison, Angel, and Jason are getting ACM membership.
