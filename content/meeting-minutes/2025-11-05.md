# 2025-11-05 ACM Officers' Meeting

## Too many accounts!!

- minnehack github
- minnehack twitter
- minnehack2025 github
- ~acmsite github org~ (arbor pruned)

Alison said it's probably fine to consolidate under acmumn.

## Not enough accounts

Angel will post on bluesky to make our media presence real.

June got our domain working!!!

## Grant update

SAO finished by Jason. Turned in early so we have time to resubmit for December
and January.

We applied for $4,000. $3,000 not that competitive, only one event per month
gets the last $1,000 though. Not sure who's competing with us rn.

SAO never covers prizes.

SSF maybe needed.

## Minnehack planning

Exclusively minnehack, no side stuff since we're doing LAN party with IEEE the
month after.

Major League hacking prob not worth it. Lots of extra work.
We can use their docs for planning sponsor night. E.G. don't add attachments to
first e-mail out to sponsors.

## Budgeting changes

Adding ACM memberships to spring budget. Maybe coffman great hall too.

## Money needed

- $3,000 ish for rooms
- $1,000 ish for food
- $6,400 for groups

## Sponsors

We need sponsors for prize money for minnehack as well as extra money in coffers.

No grants give money for prizes.

Angel will make a crab.fit to get availability out for a meeting this weekend to
send out e-mails.

Alison says we should itemize the cost of benefits to avoid broken linear
algebra later down the line.

We should optimize for gold tier and price the rest accordingly.

## Arbor interview project

We need to write down the oral tradition of ACM.

Getting generic docs for club are also cool.

Also filling out a history page in the website would be cool.

## Typst event

Alison will plan the event, send a poster to Angel so it gets spread around
early next week.

ROOM RESERVATION MUST HAPPEN NOW!!!

## Mass surveillance project

Jason needs monster cans.

## Self-Hosting Reflection

We need advertising. CSE newsblast hasn't reached out before. We just need
posters, not nifty cute images.

Typst has posters built in. We need to make some for drawing night as well as
show and tell.

## TODOs

- Alison: typst poster, reservations
- Angel: spread poster, organize sponsor night, post on bluesky
- Jason: mass surveillance, grants coming back
- Arbor: website
