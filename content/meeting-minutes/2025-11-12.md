## ACM Site
- Contact page: not everyone wants identifying information, but having contact info is still good to have
    - Officers get contact card? People can put what they want on there
        - Personalization dilutes non-standardization
    - Enough people are not sharing contact info that the table looks kind of bad
- Events: copying iframe from old site
- Redirects
    - Same link in different places - have one redirect link to go to somewhere external
    - External link could theoretically change -> only need to change it once
    - Change /here, /rsvp, etc to be handled by nginx/caddy
    - Having a white page is fine, most sites have that anyway, don't fix what isn't broken
- Clear out old unprofessional workdays?
    - Spock birthdays
