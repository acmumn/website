## Minutes
- CTF league
  - Hemant: Some guy from Purdue wants us to run one. Do we know anyone who wants to run CTF stuff?
  - Cole: I think they just wanted us to have a team, not run the whole league
  - Hemant: I can text Louis about this, and that CSE-IT thing from last week
- Elections
  - Mike: I have the form ready but I don't want to open it up until I know everyone who wanted to run is on it
  - Hemant: I can just ping Louis right now
  - Cole: Was he the only one we're unsure about?
  - Mike: I think so
  - Mike: Does anyone have any opinion about how to handle voting for treasurer should work, since we're electing two?
  - Kelton: I think just have people select two options
  - Mike: Cool, that's how I have it set up now
  - Louis: Hi I'm here now. I don't really want to run for any specific title but I'll stick around as an unoffical/general officer
- CTF league (reprise)
  - Louis: We should consider talking to Andrew about that, I think he likes that
  - Louis: I think we should email back and tell them we've run ctfs in the past and ask what they want from us / whether or not they have a template for ctf clubs we can use
- misc:
  - Louis: At some point once we know what the U is doing we should decide what social distancing policies to put in place
  - Louis: Irene is also going to install etherjack at some point put leave the old one installed, so Hemant will have to decide when we switch over

## Things to say
- If you continually do not do your tasks, please ask someone to do them. It is better to have someone a little bit grumpy at you than for them not to get done.
