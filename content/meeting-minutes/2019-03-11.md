## Minutes
 - Isai: Keep the garfields within the room
     - Isai: Some garfields spilled into the hall, which is unprofessional
     - Isai: No more garfields
 - Isai: Coffee & Donuts
     - Isai: I'm gonna email the professors again to let them know it's on Thursday
     - Louis: We should also tell them that no professors showed up last time
     - Louis: Also we should start emailing sooner
     - Louis: Ringo's idea was to schedule meetings with the professors at that time and then all cancel
 - Jack: MinneHack sponsor retrospective
     - Jack: I sent a survey out to MinneHack sponsors, and like 6 people answered
     - Jack: I put together a document detailing their comments
     - Highlights:
         - Check-in was cramped
         - They had to reuse mentor name tags
         - Booths weren't very effective after the swag ran out
         - Mentoring was good, somebody said we should group by technology, not by company
         - Someone (SPS?) said we should have judging figured out beforehand
         - Potentially get a bigger venue, don't have it conflict with the super bowl
     - Louis: We should look into moving the date next year
     - Isai: Jack, can you email them and find out how much it costs?
 - Ari: Friday 6PM Super Event Meeting @IEEE
     - Isai: This is gonna be a discussion about what the event should be
     - Isai: I can be there, can anyone else?
     - Ari: I think they only wanted one person
     - Louis: What is this event?
     - Isai: That's what the meeting is about
     - Louis: Also, what's the status of the LAN party?
     - Cassie: We have to submit a form, it's later in the meeting topics
     - Louis: We should let the gamers know ahead of time that we have servers
 - Isai: Target emails
     - Isai: I have to get back to Target. Don't let me forget
     - Louis: I have his number, I'll call him
 - Louis: Fridge
     - Louis: I can get a free fridge on craigslist if everyone hates this fridge
     - Isai: I can borrow a fridge this weekend
     - Isai: Where do we put this fridge
     - Louis: Just put it in the hall for Reuse
     - Jack: Can we get Reuse to just come get it?
     - Louis: I say we get a working fridge before we throw this one away
 - Isai: CTF 3 outreach
     - Michael: We have posters
     - Isai: The posters won't be enough
     - Louis: Ringo didn't want to hang the posters up yet
     - Isai: Just do it anyway
     - Isai: You all should also advertise in my security class
     - Louis: I can do that

     - Isai: We're getting more food this time because we expect more people
     - Louis: Have we emailed Brooksource yet?
     - Isai: No, I need to do that
     - Louis: We should email a bunch of people
     - Louis: Actually I changed my mind that's a bad idea
 - Thomas: Service event
     - Thomas: Ben Koch wanted to know what service event we were going to do at the cookout
     - Louis: That rice thing he suggested sounded fine
     - Cassie: Do it didn't
     - Louis: We could make a template email and have them email their representatives
     - Louis: We could support net neutrality
     - Jack: Why can we not just take money in exchange for hotdogs?
     - Thomas: Ben said students don't like that (?)
     - Louis: Let's email him back and say we're still thinking
     - Isai: If we do just take money, is everyone okay with that?
     - Cassie: We already submitted our event as free food in exchange for service
     - Isai: We can change that, probably
     - Thomas will email Ben Koch
     - Louis: We should give people a choice between money or service
