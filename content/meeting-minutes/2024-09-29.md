# Topics for Discussion
- SSF results, mitigation
  - SSF has gotten back
  - Except bc the room reservation problems, two are not approved
  - One option is having a workshop in the hour or two before presentation night to effectively combine the events with one-or-both attendance and shared pizza provisions
  - Another is just not having pizza at workshop
  - And another is talking to Shana about getting departmental funding
  - Or having a workshop the monday before the tuesday presentation (less than ideal but def viable)
- Carpet cleaning notice
  - all scheduled and notices put up on the door
  - we will batch the @everyone discord announcement with the UNIX class one tomorrow
- mailing list contacts -> newsletter pipeline
  - Elena did import the mailing list amalgamate every week by sunday so Quinn can do the newsletter on Monday
    - Download CSV and upload to Mailchimp, tagging it e.g. 2024 new recruits or something
- Door access ratification
  - Perhaps batch door access notification to fill out membership form
- SUA MH meeting (30m weekday)
  - We have to have a Zoom meeting to confirm MH details to get an accurate/precise cost estimate

      - Iris seems to be responding to the guy as I type
    - "Incoming freshman" with "experience in planning events" and "resumé included"
      - We ought to give this fellow a polite "no"
      - We ought not to spend the time to provide a detailed explanation
