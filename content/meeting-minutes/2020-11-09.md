## Topics for Discussion
- CTF

## Minutes
- CTF
    - Andrew Bao: I can write web, mobile, binary challenges
    - Louis: In the past, we have had around 25 challenges
    - Hemant & Louis: IRT difficulty of challenges, people at the U are usually new to the scene so they won't necessarily have much experience doing CTF
    - Andrew Pan: CTF is on the 19th, 10 days from now. We want to have challenges written before then.
