Hi ACM,

Just like that, it's the last week of UNIX Class! Join us on Tuesday, Oct. 8 at 5:30pm in Amundson B75 to learn about Dependencies and Nix! If you have not yet attended your 3 events to qualify for ACM membership benefits, this is a good way to do it. RSVP [here](@/rsvp.md).

Open House is Wednesday 4-6pm in the ACM Room (Keller 2-204) as always. This can also count towards your 3 events for membership, plus it's a good way to meet people and hang out.

Computerly,

Quinn
