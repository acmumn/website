I love ACM!

## Presentation Night is this Wednesday!
Come talk to us about your favorite obscure programming language, tell a really elaborate joke, or anything else you want to present to people about! Or simply watch and enjoy with some free pizza!
- April 23 @ 5:30pm
- Keller 3-115
- RSVP for the free pizza → [acm.umn.edu/rsvp](@/rsvp.md)
- Let an ACM officer know in person or on the discord if you'd like to present

And naturally,

```
Open House
ACM room (Keller 2-204)
Wednesdays 4-6pm
Hang out, chat, study, anything you want!
```

Really,

Quinn

_Secretary, ACM UMN_
