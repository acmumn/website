Hi ACM,

Ah! Week 4:

UNIX Class #2 is on Tuesday (Sept. 24, 5:30pm in Amundson B75). We are learning Git this week! Beginners are more than welcome as always, and it's okay if you missed the first class, you can still attend. RSVP if you plan on coming so we can get you enough free pizza. And feel free to use the same form to RSVP for next week's free pizza where we will be learning about Programming Environments.

Open House Wednesday 4-6pm in Keller 2-204 (ACM room!). It's so fun and awesome.

See you soon,

Quinn
