Hi ACM,


Week 3 now. Things are happening. Take a look:

UNIX Classes start this Tuesday (Sept. 17, 5:30pm in Amundson B75)! Join us to learn about Shell Basics. Beginners absolutely welcome. RSVP for free pizza, and use the same form to RSVP for next week's lesson #2 on Git while you're at it.

Also remember Open House is every Wednesday 4-6pm in Keller 2-204 (the ACM room!). Hang out, chat, study, etc. New people are always welcome too — it's never too late to get acquainted.

Hope classes are going well and you're finding your pacing. The ACM room is a good place to chill/study between classes if the door is open (or if you have door access; come to three events → become a member).


:),

Quinn
