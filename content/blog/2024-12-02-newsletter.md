Hi ACM,

Good job on thanksgiving! Now get ready because this week we are hosting our last event of the semester:

## Presentation Night!
- Come talk to us about your favorite obscure programming language, tell a really elaborate joke, or anything else you want to present to people about!
- Or simply enjoy watching others' presentations while treating yourself to free pizza! 🍕
```
// Dec. 3 at 5pm in Amundson 120
// Please RSVP so we get enough pizza → acm.umn.edu/rsvp
// (and let an officer know if you plan to present)
```

```
+
Open House
Wednesdays 4-6pm
ACM Room (Keller 2-204)
Come say hi
```



In good faith,

Quinn
