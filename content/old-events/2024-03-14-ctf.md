## What is this?

Learn how to "hack" with ACM's Capture the Flag event! You'll be put in a hypothetical scenario with
a computer system to intrude. This computer system will contain protected information ("flags") that
you acquire to earn points. Beginners welcome! We'll give you a crash course on the ins and
outs. And provide **pizza**.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

No prior knowledge is needed, but being able to SSH into CSE Labs or having a Linux environment available *may* help.

## Where is this?

Keller Hall 3-111. This physical event is just the kickoff, we'll keep the game server running for another
22 hours afterward. Don't fret if you won't be able to make it, but remember that we have **free pizza**!
