## What is a "Blog Workshop"?

Making a website can be daunting. The ACM UMN can help! Our Blog Workshop series of events will
focus on helping everybody set up their very own personal site. And pizza. We'll have pizza.

## What is this specific meeting for?

We'll be setting up your website from an ACM UMN designed template, version controlling it
with Git, and deploying an initial version to the interwebs.

## What do I need to know?

Nothing! Well, optimally, you would know how to type and how to use Git. We'll help you get up
to speed if you need help.

## Sounds cool, where and when is this happening?

Keller Hall 3-125 at 18:00 on Feburary 25th. Be there or be square!

## Organizer

* Andrew
