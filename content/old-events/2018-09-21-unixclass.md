## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The second UNIX Class will be about Git and GitHub. This will build on the first class, though attendance of it is not required.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

It will be helpful to have some knowledge of UNIX or have attended the first class. All you need to bring is yourself, your computer, and hunger for pizza. 

## What dietary restrictions do you cater to?

We always have vegan and vegetarian options! We also (usually) bring lactaid for people who like cheese pizza, but cannot consume lactose. 

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.

The second UNIX Class is September 21st from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm. The next UNIX Classes will be in the same time and place, just one week later. (9/28, 10/5).
