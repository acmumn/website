Learn practical UNIX skills!

<!-- more -->

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend virtually?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required!
If you missed the previous class, that's not required for this one, so feel free to attend!

## What will be Covered in this class?

This class will be covering git & github. 
Git is a version control system used by most programming projects in "the real world", as well as for a lot of classes!

## Where are the UNIX Classes?

Bruininks Hall 220
