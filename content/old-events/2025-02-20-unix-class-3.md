Learn practical UNIX skills!

<!-- more -->

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system
in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What do I need to know before I attend virtually?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required!
If you missed the previous class, that's not required for this one, so feel free to attend!

## What will be Covered in this class?

This class will be covering how to customize your programming environment!
We'll be going over how to use SSH keys in more places than Github, alternative shells to improve your terminal experience, and cool tricks in VSCode to help you write code faster.
