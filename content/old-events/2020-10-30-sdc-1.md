## What is SDC?
The Software Design Competition, or SDC for short, is like a more
realistic hackathon. Students are tasked with designing a piece of
software to solve a problem. They then create a concept and prototype
a solution to fit the requirements of the problem.

This year we have $1400 in prizes. (see below for details)

### How does it work?
The competition is spread over two weeks (and one day). During the first week,
competitors ideate and design their concept. Competitors can use the
second week to implement a prototype of their idea. Everything comes
together on the third Friday for final judging.

### What do I need to participate?
Participation is absolutely free to any UMN student! All you need is a computer, some
spunk, and a handful of good ideas.

### When is SDC?
