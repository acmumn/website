## Information

*Why do I care?*
In many CS classes at the University of Minnesota, working with CSE Lab machines and UNIX systems is important. Despite many students spending hours working in the shell and with other tools, there’s not always enough time for these tools to be covered in classes.

In Unix Classes, we'll teach you the basics of working with the shell and the command line, as well as scripting, Git (version control), Vim (+ other editors), and other important topics to Computer Science. No prior knowledge of UNIX is required! 

Plus, there's free food! Attendance is free as always and open to anyone.

*What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?*

UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We'll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including
the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.

## What will be Covered in this class?

This class will be covering Git & Github; they are not the same thing! Git is a version control system used by most programming projects in "the real world", as well as for a lot of classes.

**If you missed the first Unix Class, that's okay!**
