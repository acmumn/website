Learn practical UNIX skills!

<!-- more -->


## What do I need to know before I attend?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required! Just bring yourself, your laptop, and a hunger for **pizza**.
Having attended the first event will be helpful, but is not required.

## What will be covered?

This week we will be discussing **git**. Many computer science classes at the U use git, as do the vast majority of companies.
Come and learn how to use the world's most popular version control system!

## What dietary restrictions do you cater to?

We always have vegan and vegetarian options! 

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.

## Where are the UNIX Classes?

Keller 3-115 for all dates.
