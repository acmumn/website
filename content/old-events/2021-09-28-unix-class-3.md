## What do I need to know before I attend?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required! Just bring yourself, your laptop, and a hunger for **pizza**.
Attending the first event will be helpful, but is not required.

## What will be covered?

This week we will be discussing **vim**. Vim is an extremely powerful text editor. 
If you ever wanted to be faster or more effecient when writing and editing code, come learn all about vim!
