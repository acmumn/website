Come read a paper with ACM! Never read an academic paper before? This is a great place to start! We’ll be reading a virtual reality paper talking about locomotion techniques!


<!-- more -->


## What’s this about?

Learn how to read through a research paper and cool topics like virtual reality and locomotion. 

We’ll be reading [“Impossible Spaces: Maximizing Natural Walking in Virtual Environments with Self-Overlapping Architecture”](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/document/6165136) by the department’s very own Evan Suma Rosenberg!

Feel free to read through the paper ahead of time (even if it’s just the abstract) and come discuss it with fellow interested individuals.
