## What's this about?

Interested parties will read a paper ahead of the meeting, and discuss it over pizza with others interested in the paper's subject.
While we encourage you to read the paper ahead of time **it is not required**, feel free to come even if you haven't read (all of) the paper!
The paper we will be reading is [Is bob sending mixed signals? By Michael Schliep, Ian Kariniemi, and Nicholas Hopper](https://z.umn.edu/paperpals2021). 
Please also bring suggestions for papers to read for the second meeting.

## Where and when?
