Learn practical UNIX skills!

<!-- more --> 

## What do I need to know before I attend?

No prior knowledge of UNIX is required! Just bring yourself, your laptop, and a hunger for **pizza**.

## What dietary restrictions do you cater to?

We always have vegan and vegetarian options! We also (usually) bring lactaid for people who like cheese pizza, but cannot consume lactose. 

If you are gluten free, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you.

## Where are the UNIX Classes?
Amundson 240 for all dates.
