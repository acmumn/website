## What are the UNIX Class Topics?

The fourth UNIX Class will discuss further aspects of UNIX systems (exact subjects TBD.) This will build on the first three classes, though attendance of them is not required.

## What do I need to know before I attend?

It will be helpful to have some knowledge of UNIX or have attended the previous three classes.

## Where are the UNIX Classes?
Join [this Zoom meeting](https://umn.zoom.us/j/94671188389). You'll also be able to view the terminal session via ssh.
