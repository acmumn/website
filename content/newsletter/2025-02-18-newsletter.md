Hi ACM,

It's been a bit since we checked in email-wise but thank you and congratulations to everyone who participated in MinneHack a couple weeks ago! With your help it was a great success and we loved seeing your projects!

In terms of this week:

UNIX Class #3 is this Thursday! Come to learn about Programming Environments (and stay for the free pizza).
- Feb 20 at 5pm in Smith Hall 331
- RSVP so we get enough pizza for you 🍕 → [acm.umn.edu/rsvp](@/rsvp.md)
(+ Feel free to RSVP for next week's class — the last one — on Dependencies and Nix while you're at it.)

And of course,

```
ACM Open House
Wednesdays 4-6pm
ACM Room (Keller 2-204)
Come say hi!
```

Very respectfully,

Quinn
