Hello everyone!! I finally figured out that it's Week 10. What the heck?

## Presentation Night

ACM will be hosting a Presentation Night this Thursday, March 21 at Keller 3-111 from 6:00PM-8:00PM!

If you've ever wanted to talk to a captive audience about your favorite little hyperfixation, a weird programming language, or a cool project you've done, this is the time! We are looking for speakers! DM Autumn (auctumnus) or RIley (zackerthescar) on Discord to save a spot for Presentation Night!

Don't wanna present but still want to show up and listen? That cool too! Everyone is welcome! RSVP for Presentation Night with [this link](@/rsvp.md).

## Microhack update

Thanks to everyone who showed interest in Microhack, we have good news! The hacking period for Microhack will be held from 6pm Friday, March 22 to 6pm Sunday, March 24. We'll be starting with an (optional) kickoff event in Keller 3-230 at 5:30pm on March 22, so mark your calendars! If you are interested, please join the Microhack discord server. All further information will be communicated in this server, including the link to the Devpost and more updates as the event gets closer. Hope to see you all at kickoff!

## Open House

Our Open House for this semester will be every Wednesday 4:00PM - 6:00PM! Come hang out with us at the ACM Club Room at Keller 2-204! Come hang, introduce yourself, lounge and chill. We promise we don't bite!
