**Upcoming event announcements**

Hello all,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the near future:

**UNIX Classes**
Over the next few weeks we will be teaching four classes on the UNIX command line, covering a range of topics from the basics you'll need for your CSCI classes to some more advanced material in later meetings. The first class will be held on October 6th at 6pm and will cover shell basics.

**Paper Pals**
The first meeting of our academic paper reading group will be held on Tuesday, October 27th at 5pm. The paper we will be reading for this meeting is Parallel Nondeterministic Programming as a Language Extension to C. You can find a copy of this paper at [https://z.umn.edu/paperpals2020/](https://z.umn.edu/paperpals2020/). No experience or advanced knowledge is necessary for this event, all skill levels are welcome. This meeting of Paper Pals will also feature a talk by the author of the paper.
