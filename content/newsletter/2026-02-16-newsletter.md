Hello people,

Thanks to everyone who came to MinneHack this weekend! We had a great time
running it, and we hope you had a great time participating!

For those new to ACM, we run events every week or so with open houses in our
clubroom in Keller.

If you attend three events, you can get membership by filling out our [member
form](/member/). This gives you door access to our room, a virtual machine in
our server closet for your blog, minecraft, and/or git server, and the ability
to host your own machines in our closet too!

RSVP to our events here 👉 [RSVP](/rsvp/) to help us get more pizza money.

## Unix Class 3: Programming Environment ⌨️
Keller 3-125, TODAY Monday 5:30PM

Frustrated with ssh keys, CSE lab machines, and slash or confusing VSCode
settings???? Learn how to set up VSCode, bashrc, and ssh connections to work for
YOU, not the other way around at Unix Class 3!

## Open House 🛖
ACM Clubroom (Keller 2-204), Mondays + Fridays 4:30-6:30PM

Hang out, chat, study, be cool, calm, and collected B-) .
