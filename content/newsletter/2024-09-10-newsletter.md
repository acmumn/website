Hi ACM,

Week 2 and we're already going strong. Notable announcements for this week:

Our About ACM dates were moved to Tuesday, Sept. 10 (tonight!) and Thursday, Sept. 12, still at 5pm in Keller 2-204 for each. If you're new, we'd love to see you at one of the two days, just try to RSVP if you plan on attending. (And join the Discord to keep up with events and schedule changes like these in real time.)

We'll also be hosting our first Open House of the year this Wednesday at 5pm, so come hang with us in the ACM room (Keller 2-204), or use this as an opportunity to get a sampling of the club if you can't make it to About ACM.

UNIX Classes are getting started next week (Sept. 17, 5:30pm in Amundson B75)! These are a good way to learn essential skills that you will need for your classes and beyond, beginning with shell basics for the first class. RSVP for free pizza!

That should do it. It's been nice seeing familiar faces as well as new ones in the ACM room. Come say hi if you haven't yet, the more the merrier.

Have a nice week,

Quinn
