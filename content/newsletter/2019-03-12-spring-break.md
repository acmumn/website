Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks:

 - **Coffee & Donuts with the CS&E Department:**
   - Come grab some refreshments and chat with professors, researchers, advisors, and other students in the computer science and engineering department. This event will be held in Keller Hall 3-176 on Thursday, March 14th.

 - **Officer Elections:**
   - ACM UMN will be holding officer elections for next year after spring break. If you would like to run for any officer position, you can sign up using [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/UmtqbF7gvihlrZxg1). You must be a paid member of ACM UMN to vote in our officer elections.

 - **Spring LAN Party:**
   - ACM UMN, IEEE, and UMN eSports will be hosting a LAN party in the Keller atrium during CSE week. Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to the date of the event.

 - **CTF 3:**

If you would like to compete, please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/MPz7RHfvXckZQr123) with your availability so that we can choose a date for the event.

Non ACM UMN Events:

If you want to get more involved with ACM UMN or see what we’re up to, you can stop by our room, Keller Hall 2-204, any time. In addition, our weekly officer meetings are held on Mondays at 7:00 pm in Keller Hall 2-204, and our meeting minutes can be found [on our website](@/meeting-minutes/_index.md).
