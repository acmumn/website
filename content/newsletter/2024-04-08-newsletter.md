T - 2 weeks, gearing up for finals, and we have some exciting stuff in this letter, so pay attention!

## Paper Pals

ACM will be hosting Paper Pals next week on Wednesday (4/10) from 6:00PM-7:00PM at Akerman Hall 327! This is the event where we collectively read a paper and discuss it together as a club! We'll be reading and discussing Multi-Touch Querying on Data Physicalizations in Immersive AR by Herman et. al, which you can find at https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3488542

We do recommend reading the paper ahead of time, but feel free to attend even without having read the paper! RSVP for Paper Pals now at https://acm.umn.edu/rsvp!

## Open House

Our Open House for this semester will be every Wednesday 4:00PM - 6:00PM! Come hang out with us at the ACM Club Room at Keller 2-204! Come hang, introduce yourself, lounge and chill. We promise we don't bite!
