Hello everyone!! Time is quite the whirlwind, huh? I've forgotten way too many Weekly Newsletters to count, but I remembered right in time for one of ACM's big events this semester!

# Capture the Flag

One of our big events this semester, Capture the Flag is a grand tour and test of your cybersecurity skills and knowledge!

The objective: find hidden strings (known as "flags") within literally anything we're throwing at you - from web servers and applications to photo files and potentially even more.

The techniques: anything and everything a cool person would use, from reading object dumps and understanding code to sleuthing and appreciating art on the internet!

Capture the Flag is a beginner-friendly event, so feel free to show up no matter what you feel your skill level is! We'll be here to show off the techniques commonly found in CTF challenges, and some of the flags can be extracted in very unexpected ways!

Capture the Flag kicks off at Keller Hall 3-111 on Thursday March 14 at 6:00PM-8:00PM! Don't worry if you can't come in-person, though! The CTF server runs for 24 hours after the kickoff - and you'll have the chance to compete remotely at [https://ctf.acm.umn.edu/](https://ctf.acm.umn.edu/)

# Microhack update

Thanks to everyone who showed interest in Microhack, we have good news! The hacking period for Microhack will be held from 6pm Friday, March 22 to 6pm Sunday, March 24. We'll be starting with an (optional) kickoff event in Keller 3-230 at 5:30pm on March 22, so mark your calendars! If you are interested, please join the Microhack discord server. All further information will be communicated in this server, including the link to the Devpost and more updates as the event gets closer. Hope to see you all at kickoff!

# Open House

Our Open House for this semester will be every Wednesday 4:00PM - 6:00PM! Come hang out with us at the ACM Club Room at Keller 2-204! Come hang, introduce yourself, lounge and chill. We promise we don't bite!he door lock on Keller 2-204 does not work right now (>_<), but we anticipate the door lock working for Open House. If it does, drop by for a quick celebration! If not, we'll let you know on our Discord
