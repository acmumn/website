Hi ACM,

Week 9. According to online, 9 is a powerful symbol of completion, wisdom, and spiritual growth. It's very interesting.

We don't have a special thing this week, but next week...

## Learn how to “hack” in a friendly Capture the Flag (CTF) competition!

Vulnerable systems ranging from websites to filesystems will be provided and points will be awarded based on your reverse engineering ability. Beginners welcome, we will provide help!
It's a 24-hour event, but be there for kick-off on Nov. 6 at 7pm in Amundson B75. Free pizza provided 🍕 → [rsvp](@/rsvp.md)

And remember our weekly Open House, wednesday 4-6pm in the ACM Room (Keller 2-204). This is your chance to enjoy our perpetual halloween decorations during the short window of the year when they are proper by common standards.


Yup,

Quinn
