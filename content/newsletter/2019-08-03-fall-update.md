# Howdy ACMers,

We hope you all are having great summers! We have just a few quick updates for you about goings on at ACM.

We just got done deciding the dates for most of the fall ACM events and just wanted to let you know whats going on during the first couple months of the school year.

These [events](@/events.md) are also listed on our website.

Donuts with the Department - Sep 9, 9-10 AM in the IMA Reception Room (Keller 3rd Floor)
The first event of the year where you can get to know CSE professors, grad TAs, other CSE faculty, and other students through a social event with free donuts and coffee.

We also have two more of these scheduled for Oct 7 and Nov 4 (same time/location).

Resume/Interview Prep Event - Sep 10, 7-8:30 PM in Bruininks 420A

The Disability Resource Center also wanted us to let you all know about an employment opportunity at the U. They are currently looking for students who have taken CSCI 4061 and/or CSCI 5304 for employment as an Access Assistant Tutor through their office.

If you are interested in this role, follow this link, click "Students" in the "Apply Now!" section, and then search for "331719".

Also, later in the semester, we will be hosting another CTF! This will be "trivia-style" online sets of cybersecurity challenges that competitors complete on their own to earn points, the winner being the team with the most points after a fixed amount of time. These challenges are practical applications of skills including cryptography, networking, web security, stenography, scripting, and more! We are running one of these events on December 3rd, 2019. This is a low-key event, and would be a great first practical security experience!
