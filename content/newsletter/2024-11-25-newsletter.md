Hi ACM,

As you know, it's a week of reprieve. We hope you find yourself with good thanks and graces.

But on the Tuesday right after the break, ACM will be hosting...

## Presentation Night!
- Come talk to us about your favorite obscure programming language, tell a really elaborate joke, or anything else you want to present to people about!
- Or simply enjoy watching others' presentations while treating yourself to free pizza! 🍕
- Dec. 3 at 5pm in Amundson 120
- Please RSVP so we get enough pizza → [acm.umn.edu/rsvp](@/rsvp.md)
