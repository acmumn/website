Hi ACM,

It seems like it's week 7. That's good I think. If we took the path of the sun from the beginning of the semester as Portland, Maine to the end of the semester as Portland, Oregon, we'd roughly be in the Twin Cities right now with the time coming 'round near noon o'clock. Lots more daylight still.

With UNIX Classes behind us, the week is fairly quiet ACM-wise. But per usual, catch us at Open House on Wednesday (4-6pm in the ACM Room (Keller 2-204)). Here you will find us doing our weekly group chilling.

On the horizon, Self-Hosting Workshop is next week on Thursday. RSVP now if you're interested: [acm.umn.edu/rsvp](@/rsvp.md). It helps us get you enough free pizza.

I'll see you later.

Truly,

Quinn
