Hi ACM,

Welcome to the new school year and another exciting year of ACM! You likely have lots to do — us too. So quickly,

## About ACM

For those who are new, we will be running two nights of About ACM, first on Thursday, Sept. 5 and then on Wednesday, Sept. 11, both at 5pm in Keller Hall Room 2-204. We’ll show you around the clubroom, let you know what we do and how you can get involved, and more. It’s a casual event (as all our events are), we only ask that you if you plan on attending you RSVP for your preferred day at acm.umn.edu/rsvp.

## Open House (But Not This Week!)

Open houses for this semester will be every Wednesday 4-6pm, except for this week. During this time, we welcome you to hang with us in the ACM room, talk to us and each other, just soak up the space, whatever you’d like. This week tho, find us at Fall Tech Kickoff on Wednedsay.

## Fall Tech Kickoff (Tonight!)

ACM plus many other tech clubs at UMN will be at Fall Tech Kickoff (Sept. 4 at 5-7pm, HSEC Room 3-110). Say hi to us and get to know the larger community. It’s fun to get involved with different scenes, network between them, etc.

## UNIX Classes

Before you know it, we will be hosting our popular UNIX classes. Look forward to the first one on 9/17, and stay tuned for more info.

Shout out to newheads and oldheads alike and thank you everyone for being here. :)

See you soon,

Quinn
