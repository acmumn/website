All the special events are up, it's the final slide of the year, and ACM UMN is figuring out officers for next year.

Current members (have attended 3 events this school year, have paid a $10 fee this academic year, or have paid a $5 fee this semester) may submit their candidacy if they'd like here.

If you need a break from the studying, or a space to change up your rhythm as you work, stop by...

```
Open House
ACM room (Keller 2-204)
Wednesdays 4-6pm
Hang out, chat, study, anything you want!
```

By chance,

Quinn

_Secretary, ACM UMN_
