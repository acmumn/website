Hey ACM,

Drawing night is this week (tomorrow — wednesday 3/4 at 4pm), join us in the ACM room (Keller 2-204) to help renew our semesterly canvas that we display in there! We get lots of different styles from every skill level, we encourage everyone to contribute.

Also, this will take place at the same place and time as our usual open house, so you may go to that as well, we will just be using a part of the room to draw.

Happy birthdays,

Quinn
