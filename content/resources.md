UNIX Class content for the F2021 semester will be posted here soon.

Some books (including some books required for CSCI and MATH courses) may be checked out [from our club library](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E41HMi-UMuuOjOiDlHnmpadpqBOudx8P2hRbqV7zZOo/edit?usp=sharing) if you are a member. Generally we do not allow people to check books out for a whole semester, but you are free to reference them or check them out to use for an open-book test.
