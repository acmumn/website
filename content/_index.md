### Who are we? 

We are the Association for Computing Machinery, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities student chapter. We work to promote knowledge and greater interest in the science, design, development, language, management, and applications of modern computing on the Twin Cities campus and around the Twin Cities area.

Our [constitution](/static/constitution.pdf), [bylaws](/static/bylaws.pdf), and [rules](/static/rules.pdf) are available online.

### What do we do?

We normally provide a place on campus in Keller Hall, room 2-204, where anyone can come to meet and discuss computing.

This year, things are a bit different. Our club room is closed due to covid-19, so the best way to get involved is to chat during the ACM social hour every Tuesday from 5-6 PM CT on our discord [https://discord.gg/Uzt3adQ](https://discord.gg/Uzt3adQ).
Come drop by if you're a computer science student, a computer engineering student, an electrical engineering student, or just someone interested in computing!
<!-- Our room is open to any and all, and we welcome computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering students, as well as anyone with an interest in computing or programming. Dropping by our room is the easiest way to get involved beyond attending events. [More about this space](/room). -->

We provide computing resources to our members. These include website hosting, gigabit Internet connection, high powered servers, IRC and Discord servers, and other miscellaneous utilities. Members are granted access to a virtual machine our server `argo`, a dual Xeon E5-2430 system with 32GB RAM and over 5TB of available disk.

We also host several events throughout the year, including MinneHack (the largest Hackathon in Minnesota), the UMN Software Design Competition, Capture-the-Flag cybersecurity events, and the semesterly Keller LAN Party.

### Who can be a member?

Membership is open to anyone and everyone who's interested in computing. Enrollment at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, or even as a student in general is not required. For Fall 2020, the membership fee have been waived. In its place, **you can fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/hZzG1uRBu6kAKL3dA/) to become a member**.

Becoming a member (which, again, is free this year) grants you:
 - A virtual machine on our server hardware
 - Access to member-only channels in the discord
 - Access to colocation in our server closet 

<!-- The cost of membership is $5 per semester. The easiest way to get involved to drop by our room (Keller 2-204,) especially during our open houses 15:00-17:00 on Thursdays.

To pay your membership fee, use one of the following e-payment links and email your receipt to `acm@umn.edu`:  [semester](https://z.umn.edu/acmsm) ($5) or [year](https://z.umn.edu/acmam) ($10). [Learn more about what membership gets you](/room). -->
