Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks:

 - **UNIX Classes:**
   - ACM UMN is teaching UNIX classes on Fridays in Mechanical Engineering room 108 from 12:00 to 1:00. This week we are teaching our fourth and final UNIX Class on pipes and filters. If you've never really used UNIX or the command line before, this is a great primer. Mesa pizza will also be proved. We will have vegan and vegetarian options available. No prior knowledge of UNIX is required, just bring yourself, your computer, and a hunger for pizza.

 - **Software Design Competition:**
   - The first meeting of our Software Design Competition, the design week kickoff, will be held on Monday, October 15th in Bruininks Hall 131A at 6:00 PM. At the Software Design Competition, or SDC for short, students will work alone or in teams over the course of two weeks to design a piece of software to solve a given problem. Participation is absolutely free, and there will be prizes to be determined. Sign up at [this link](https://z.umn.edu/sdcf18) or learn more at [our website](https://acm.umn.edu/events).

If you want to get more involved with ACM UMN or see what we’re up to, you can stop by our room, Keller Hall 2-204, any time. In addition, our weekly officer meetings are held on Mondays at 7:00 pm, and our meeting minutes can be found [on our website](https://acm.umn.edu/meeting-minutes). You can also join our [Discord server](https://z.umn.edu/acm-discord).

Have a great week!
