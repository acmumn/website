Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks and months:

 - We will be holding a resume and interview prep event on September 12th in Keller Hall 3-210 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm. Come by to find out what hiring reps are looking for and get tips to improve your resume. Representatives from SPS Commerce will be there. Pizza will also be provided for event attendees.

 - ACM UMN is teaching UNIX classes the next four Fridays in Mechanical Engineering room 108 from 12:00 to 1:00. The first UNIX Class will be on shell basics. If you've never really used UNIX or the command line before, this is a great primer. Mesa pizza will also be proved. We will have vegan and vegetarian options available. No prior knowledge of UNIX is required, just bring yourself, your computer, and a hunger for pizza.
