Hello ACM UMN members,

Here are some of the events we have coming up in the next few weeks:
 
 - **Coffee & Donunts with the CS&E Department**:
   - Come grab some refreshments and meet professors, researchers, advisors, and other students in the computer science and engineering department. This event will be held in the main floor of Keller Hall, above the atrium tomorrow on Tuesday, October 9th at 11 am.

 - **Software Design Competition:**
   - The first meeting of our Software Design Competition, the design week kickoff, will be held on Monday, October 15th in Bruininks Hall 131A at 6:00 PM. At the Software Design Competition, or SDC for short, students will work alone or in teams over the course of two weeks to design a piece of software to solve a given problem. Participation is absolutely free, and there will be prizes to be determined. Sign up at [this link](https://z.umn.edu/sdcf18) or learn more at [our website](https://acm.umn.edu/events).

If you want to get more involved with ACM UMN or see what we’re up to, you can stop by our room, Keller Hall 2-204, any time. In addition, our weekly officer meetings are held on Mondays at 7:00 pm, and our meeting minutes can be found [on our website](https://acm.umn.edu/meeting-minutes). You can also join our [Discord server](https://z.umn.edu/acm-discord).

Have a great week!
