# Contributing

Look in the Github Issues for things to help with.

[PROJECT_ORGANIZATION](PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md) has notes on the project structure.

## Submission

Make sure to create new branches off of `dev` not `main`.

PR code from your feature branch onto `dev` and get it reviewed by someone before merging.

PRs that are just text content really only need a quick check.

Try to follow the [Conventional Commits](www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit format.

## Officers Making a Contact Card

The contacts page of the site has a place to put officer contact cards.
If you are an officer who has not made a contact card, see [OFFICER_STICKY_NOTES](OFFICER_STICKY_NOTES.md) to set one up.
