# Contributing

## Getting Started

The easiest way to help is to look in the Github Issues. Writing text content (in markdown) for the site is much appricated! Look for issues marked Good First Issue.

## Submission Process

0. Create an issue or comment on one, explaining what you will be working on
1. Checkout _dev_
2. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name, in lowercase with hyphens
3. Make your changes
4. Push your feature branch
5. Create a pull request to merge your feature to _dev_
6. Ask someone (`arbormoss@woodsprite.dev` or another contributer) to review your code by email
7. Once your PR is merged, make sure your feature branch is deleted

For PRs that are just content and already have an issue, you don't need to discuss, just leave a comment and have at it. For larger changes and refactors, make sure to have a discussion in the Github Issues before making a PR.

I can also transfer the ownership of this repo to ACM UMN if that's helpful at some point.

## Notes

- Try to vaguely follow [conventional commits](www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit format.
- Small text content PRs are welcomed.
- Feel free to open an issue, even just to ask a question or have a discussion.
