# Contributing

## Getting Started

The easiest way to help is to look in the Github Issues. Writing text content (in markdown) for the site is much appreciated! Look for issues marked Good First Issue.

Check out [PROJECT_ORGANIZATION](PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md) to get an idea of the project layout.

## Submission Process

0. Create an issue or comment on one, explaining what you will be working on
1. Checkout _dev_
2. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name, in lowercase with hyphens
3. Make your changes
4. Push your feature branch
5. Create a pull request to merge your feature to _dev_, linking it to the original issue
6. Ask someone (`arbormoss@woodsprite.dev` or another contributor) to review your code by email
7. Once your PR is merged, make sure your feature branch is deleted

For PRs that are just content and already have an issue, you don't need to discuss, just leave a comment and have at it.
For larger changes and refactors, make sure to have a discussion in the Github Issues before starting work or making a PR.

## Officers Making a Contact Card

The contacts page of the site has a place to put officer contact cards.
If you are an officer who has not made a contact card, see [OFFICER_STICKY_NOTES](OFFICER_STICKY_NOTES.md) to learn how to set one up.
