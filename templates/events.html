    <h1>Events</h1>
    <p><b>Open Houses</b> are 15:00-17:00 on Tuesdays in <a href="/room/">our club room, Keller 2-204</a>. This is a low-key general-meeting-like time that is a great opportunity for people interested in learning more and joining to drop by. We'll probably be watching Star Trek or something during this time!</p>
	<p><b>Officer meetings</b> are normally held every Wednesday at 17:30 in Keller 2-204. These are open to the public and you are welcome to attend, but they may not be very exciting. If you wish to attend a meeting it may be prudent to check that the meeting has not been canceled.</p>
