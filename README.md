# ACM UMN Website

## Background

The UMN ACM website has been in need of an upgrade.
In order to keep the site current and useful to our club this repo has been created as an eventual replacement for the old one.

## Development

This uses [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) for static site generation (just like the old site).
It also uses the SCSS flavor of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling.

### Building

1. Install Zola.
2. Clone this repo with `git clone git@github.com:arbormoss/acm-site.git`.
3. Run `zola serve` from the root of the project.
4. Go to `localhost:1111`.
